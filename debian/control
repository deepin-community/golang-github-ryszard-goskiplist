Description: A skip list implementation in Go
 This is a library implementing skip lists for the Go programming
 language (http://golang.org/).
 .
 Skip lists are a data structure that can be used in place of balanced
 trees. Skip lists use probabilistic balancing rather than strictly
 enforced balancing and as a result the algorithms for insertion and
 deletion in skip lists are much simpler and significantly faster than
 equivalent algorithms for balanced trees.
 .
 Skip lists were first described in Pugh, William (June 1990)
 (ftp://ftp.cs.umd.edu/pub/skipLists/skiplists.pdf). "Skip lists:
 a probabilistic alternative to balanced trees". Communications of the
 ACM 33 (6): 668â€“676
